    <h1>Our Team</h1>
    <p>For all the members of our team, headhunting was a deliberate career choice. Most of us began our careers at Crédey et Associés. <br>
        This means that we have shared values and a common culture but also that we share information, advice, methods and networks. <br>
        This, combined with our specialisation, means that our consultants complement one another and are especially effective.</p>
